# TicTacToe AI Game
This is a TicTacToe game AI implemented in Python, using the Minimax algorithm to play against the user. The AI is designed to be unbeatable and makes the best move possible based on the current board state.

### Important Note:
 The visual aspects of this game were not created by me. The code for the game's interface was sourced from this repository, which provided the starting point for the author to implement the Minimax algorithm and other game logic.

### Installation

To use this game, you must have Python 3 and the Pygame and NumPy libraries installed on your computer.

To install Pygame, use pip:
`pip install pygame`

### Usage

To play the game, simply navigate to the directory where you have downloaded the repository and run the following command in your terminal:
`python tictactoe.py`

Once you run this command, the game window will appear, and you can start playing against the AI. Simply click on the cell where you want to place your move, and the AI will make its move in response. The game will continue until one player wins or the board is full and the game ends in a draw.
